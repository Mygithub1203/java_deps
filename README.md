Deeplearning4j build environment
=========

This is a provisioning role to create build machines capable of building the
deeplearning4j projects from scratch: [libnd4j](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/libnd4j), [nd4j](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j), [datavec](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/datavec), [deeplearning4j](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j).

The test for these is running the main repo's [build script](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/build-dl4j-stack.sh).
